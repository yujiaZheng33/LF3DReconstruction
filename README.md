# Light Field 3D Reconstruction
This code is used to 3D reconstruct images taken by the light field camera Lytro ILLUM.This code is used to reconstruct in 3D the images taken by the light field camera Lytro ILLUM. It contains camera source data decoding, camera calibration, light field depth estimation, 3D point cloud reconstruction and more.
Hopefully it will be of some help to you if you are learning about light field cameras!
